All steps to this project have been completed, there is a readFile, executePogram, and terminate function in the kernel.c
and the Shell was created with a type and exec command. To verify that it works boot up simulator.jar and boot diskc.img 
and the OS should boot up and give a prompt "SHELL>:" and to verify that the functions work you can enter "type messag" 
(this can prove that readFile and type work properly), you can also enter "exec tstpr1" (this will verify that exec and executeProgram work)
and you can enter "exec tstpr2" (this will verify that exec, executeProgram, and terminate work).
